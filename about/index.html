                <p>I am a Software Engineer at Google working on Large Language Models and their
applications to <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/">AI Overviews for
Search</a>.
I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been at Google through the golden age of Language Models,
and got to contribute to multiple generations of LLMs - <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-mum/">Multitask Unified
Model (MUM)</a>, and
<a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/">Gemini</a>. I also have deep
domain expertise in Search, having led several highly impactful launches to
Google Search, particularly on query and document understanding.</p>
<p>Before moving to the Bay Area, I obtained my Masters in CS from UC San Diego.
Before that, I was a <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in">CSE</a> undergraduate at IIT
Madras in India, where I was generously supported by the <a href="http://www.adityabirlascholars.net">Aditya Birla
Scholarship</a>.</p>
<p>Between these stints of education, I worked on NLP models and libraries for
Android devices at Samsung in Suwon, South Korea.</p>
